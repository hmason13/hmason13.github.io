### About me

I am a PhD candidate in the [Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at NYU Courant. I like reading, writing, and sciencing about the polar regions. I also like thinking about a great number of other topics.

### About this site

This site contains the standard fare: research interests, current work, my CV, some teaching materials, and an intense headshot. But it also contains other things as well: notes & blurbs & blogs about topics I found interesting that week.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
