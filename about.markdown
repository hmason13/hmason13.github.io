### About me

I am a PhD candidate in the [Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at NYU Courant. I like reading, writing, and sciencing about the polar regions. I also like thinking about a great number of other topics.

### About this site

This site contains the standard fare: research interests, current work, my CV, some teaching materials, and an intense headshot. But it also contains other things as well: notes & blurbs & blogs about topics I found interesting that week.

After browsing the sites belonging to a few dozen familiar scientists, it seems abnormal to include material unrelated to my research. Doing so here is probably a bad idea for... reasons, I guess. But! Including odd topics could also be a good idea!
1. I need to practice writing
2. Writing about only one topic becomes stale
3. Instead of ranting over an otherwise peaceful cup of coffee, or rambling during a picturesque hike, or spamming everyone at the happy hour, I can direct people here!

Maybe I'll change my mind in the future. But in the meantime, nearly everything I write will wash up here.
