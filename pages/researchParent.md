### Modeling the Beaufort Gyre
My thesis work models the time averaged behavior of the Arctic Ocean's Beaufort Gyre. It's a near axisymmetric wind driven gyre underneath a dynamic sea ice cover and surrounded by active shelf seas. The combination of a simple geometry with complex components can produce interesting models!

One such model simulates the under ice mesoscale eddy field with high resolution flat bottom channel simulations in MITgcm. Input files and the modified restoring are available [here][amb-repo].
